  Sublime User Convenience Collection - UI replacement (work in progress)
</p>


## Important note:

**Additional configuration is required for advanced users. In the beginning of a file *SUCC-ui.lua*, configure your main action bar paging states according to stances(shapeshift forms) your character have(bottom center).

Wow client has 120 action buttons, 10 is reserved for main action bar humanoid form, and 10 for each of your stances. The available pages start from *1+n* where *n* is your characters stance count. As you can see, there are 12 pages available, 10 buttons each.
**Example:** A warrior has 3 stances, it makes pages from 5 to 12 available for use in modified(Shift pressed) bar and all the additional bars(right side bars, ring menu etc). Rogue has 1 stance, in this case all the pages from 3 to 12 are available.

## Features:

Character main cast bar, which consists of 10 buttons. It's state, by default, is modified by a Shift button. The default UI buttons are *reused* in this addon, so the keybinds are set through games default keybinding menu.

Xp/reputation bars. Xp bars behaviour is also default. The reputation bar appears on mouseover **if a factions reputation progress is tracked**.

## Recommended addons:

![succbag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17740865/38700607-7f1fb312-3e50-11e8-88cc-59d874991b0d.png)
[SUCC-bag](https://www.google.com "SUCC-bag - player inventory and bank overhaul addon for world of warcraft 1.12.1") - player inventory and bank overhaul addon.

![cooline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17740865/38700627-90c2d0ea-3e50-11e8-8003-211b89e2081b.png)
[Cooline](https://github.com/shirsig/cooline) - an addon to watch cooldowns. This addon is particularly important, because some important cooldowns may end up in the modified state bar, whose buttons are hidden when shift button is not pressed.


![ringmenu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17740865/38701380-8b770d02-3e52-11e8-87bb-00c738290844.png)
[RingMenu](https://github.com/jsb/RingMenu) - this addon adds an additional set of buttons that appear on a certain keybind. Nice little addon to have. Note that, this addon too uses buttons from games default set(120 buttons).



![castbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17740865/38700654-a1438f90-3e50-11e8-8710-e2adb3a54a07.png)
and a player castbar modification addon, for example, [Punschrulle](https://github.com/Attero/Punschrulle).

## Honorable mention:

[ls: UI](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22662-lsUI.html) - addon that inspired me for the layout.
